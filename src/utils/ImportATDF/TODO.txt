Perhaps append _t to type names for disambiguation?

Conceptual problems generating avr8X style register group records for avr8:
1. Some registers are shared across register modules, such as GTCCR. This leads to
   re-inclusion of GTCC in all timers

2. The various registers used by a module is not necessarily tightly groupd in address space.
   Example: Timer 2 ASSR register is located at 0xB6, while TIRF is located at 0x37.
   This means that 9 registers is spread out over 127 address spaces.
